generate_mvp_tracks.py — Sprint 8B batch driver.

Generates the 4 MVP tracks for Cosmos Cosmic Adventure 2026 (per
`public/assets/audio/music/_SUNO_PROMPTS.md`):

    1. title-theme.mp3        — slow-bloom psychedelic D-minor opener
    2. slow-bloom-loop.mp3    — Level 1 ambient loop (= slow-bloom-l1)
    3. inkpool-loop.mp3       — Level 4 ambient (= inkpool-hollow-l4)
    4. boss-stinger.mp3       — short stinger (5–10s) D-minor

Runs sequentially because:
  * sunoapi.org rate-limits sustained `/generate` bursts
  * we want a clean log of which prompt produced which track
  * 4 × ~3 min ≈ 12 min total walltime — acceptable

Output: `public/assets/audio/music/<name>.mp3` (and `.json` sidecar
with all variant URLs for manual A/B). On insufficient-credit failure the
script exits early so partial state is obvious.

NEVER prints the API key. Set it via the standard env-load:
    set -a; . ~/Documents/games/.env; set +a
